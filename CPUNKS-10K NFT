The use of CPUNKS-10K in research is managed by an NFT Contract published on the Moon River Main Network. In the future, I hope academic researchers will use the CPUNKS-10K contract to add value to their reesearch:
     - The contract can provide a guarantee that the research was done with a point in time snapshot of the dataset at the time of publication.
     - The contract can be used to fund the ongoing maintenance of the dataset; a researcher can decide at time of minting how much, if any, to donate to the contract. 
     - Finally, the contract can be transferred to new maintainers while maintaining the full lineage of usage in research. 
     
### Using CPUNKS-10 NFT
To use the NFT manually:
  - Visit https://moondata.io/cpunks-10 and follow the instructions to mint a new instance of the NFT.
  - When you publish your research, add the transaction hash of the NFT in your Reference section, using the below as an example:
    - tnn1t1s.eth. (2021). CPUNKS-10K (Moonriver version) [data file and codebook]. mrc:<<contract_id_here>>

### Why MoonRiver 
MoonRiver provides full ERC721 NFT compatibility without the high gas feeds we've come to expect on the Ethereum mainnet. For example, at the time of this writing, creating a new CPUNKS-10K on Ethereum would cost 
approximately 1250 USD while the same contract minted on MoonRiver will cost less than $1USD. High gas fees would make using the dataset prohibitively expensive and I favor 
using the contract to make donations to the contract maintainer over fees on Ethereum network.
